# TSPNFINAL

The cost of living crisis has caused a surge in the number of people experiencing food insecurity. The Scottish Pantry Network (TSPN) work with local food pantries to help people in this situation.  Food pantries are located in local communities and provide members with heavily discounted food. 
TSNP is aware that Glasgow City Council has recently been providing grants for small local organisations to grow food in locations such as community gardens and schools across the city.
