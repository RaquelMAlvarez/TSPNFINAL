Scottish Pantry Network (TSPN) Web Application 

The Scottish Pantry Network (TSPN) has launched an innovative web application aimed at addressing the pressing issue of food insecurity amidst the current cost of living crisis. This platform serves as a vital bridge between individuals with surplus food to donate and local food pantries striving to meet the needs of their communities. 

The platform features essential functionalities such as an About Us page, providing insight into the initiative's mission and impact, and a Contact Us page equipped with a user-friendly form for inquiries and feedback. With the goal of promoting sustainability and maximizing impact, the application integrates measures to ensure that donated items are within date and usable, thereby upholding quality standards. Furthermore, items are promptly removed from display once selected by a pantry, preventing duplication, and optimizing resource allocation, also the users can easily register to donate food items, while registered pantries gain access to a comprehensive inventory of available items. 

Central to the administration of the platform is the role of administrators, who possess the authority to manage users and items, ensuring smooth operation and adherence to organizational objectives. 

In collaboration with local food pantries and supported by recent grants from Glasgow City Council, TSPN's web application represents a collaborative effort to alleviate food insecurity and foster resilience within communities across Scotland.
